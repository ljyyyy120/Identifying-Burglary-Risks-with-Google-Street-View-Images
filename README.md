## Abstract 
Resident safety is an important aspect of city life. As the city's population surges, so does criminal activity, making it especially difficult to monitor and predict crime. Burglary, one of the most common forms of crime in New York City, poses a serious threat to residents' property and personal safety. To address these issues, this study utilizes Google Street View (GSV) imagery, burglary complaint data history, and demographic data to build a predictive model of burglary risk in New York City through  different machine learning methods, especially  convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and decision trees. Focusing on Manhattan, we identified visual cues in Street View that may predict higher burglary risk. We have completed broad studies and demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing these models to assist in effective policing. By comparing different machine learning methods, this project aims to help policy makers better predict the burglary risk and implement targeted interventions to enhance urban safety.
